# FrappeGo
This Library intends to create Go struct from Frappe doctype. 

## Why this Library
If you are using Frappe and wants create Microservices which uses Golang, creating Struct and syncing with main Frappe service is difficult problem. Frappe provide very intuitive approach for adding and removing fields.But this actual leads to difference is Golang and Frappe. 

With this library I want to address this issue in two stages. 

1. It will generate Golang Struct by referring json files from Frappe.

2. It will sync Struct Fields if changes are there in Frappe.


## Goals
Following are the broader goals

- [ ] Struct Creation Functionality

- [ ] Sync Mechanism

- [ ] CLI application 

- [ ] Add Documentation

- [ ] Write Tests
